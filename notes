October 30th:
Sketched world, talked about how to implement agents and the world.
Started coding up World and Mario classes. 
November 6:
Coded up a mario simulation earlier, but wanted to start over 
because we realized that our previous design style wasn't ideal.

November 7:
Began writing the new world simulation. Create goombas, coins, 
blocks. Decided that the world could be represented by tuples that
indicate which object belongs in which grid space. 

November 12:
Designed a Mario that can move left and right, and currently 
working on jump function as well as all the boundary conditions. 

November 13:
Worked more on the update function and fixed some bugs in checkBounds.
Did a lot of testing. There are still so many bugs! 

November 16:
Fixed many bugs. Can run in simulation. Mario can kill goombas, and can be
killed by goombas in many different ways. It works by using a random generator
as well. Need to add coin count, coinbox count, secret room, and end flag. 

November 30:
Fixed coin and coin box bugs. Did a lot of testing. Connected Mario to NEAT. However, Mario seems to converge to one, bad behavior after the first generation or so. Need to check what's wrong with that.
