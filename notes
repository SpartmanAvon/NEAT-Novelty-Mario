October 30th:
Sketched world, talked about how to implement agents and the world.
Started coding up World and Mario classes. 
November 6:
Coded up a mario simulation earlier, but wanted to start over 
because we realized that our previous design style wasn't ideal.

November 7:
Began writing the new world simulation. Create goombas, coins, 
blocks. Decided that the world could be represented by tuples that
indicate which object belongs in which grid space. 

November 12:
Designed a Mario that can move left and right, and currently 
working on jump function as well as all the boundary conditions.
